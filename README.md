This repository contains an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built using Uber ride data, along with extracted **Uber vehicle icons** for visualization and documentation.


## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber rides and provide insights into:

* Ride demand across different service types (UberX, UberXL, UberPool, etc.)
* Peak hours and daily trends
* Geographic distribution of rides
* Vehicle type usage patterns
* Performance comparison across regions

The dashboard provides a **visual, interactive view** of the dataset, enabling stakeholders to make **data-driven decisions**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI (PBIX)** → Interactive dashboard design
* **Python (PIL)** → Cropped Uber vehicle icons from the original image set
* **Excel/CSV** → Source dataset (if shared)
